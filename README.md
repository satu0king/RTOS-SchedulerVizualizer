# RTOS-SchedulerVizualizer

Scheduling is core to any real time system. In this project we will explore 3 popular real time scheduling algorithms.

* RMS (Rate-monotonic Scheduling)
* EDF (Earliest Deadline First Scheduling)
* Fixed Priority (Fixed Priority scheduling algorithm)

Both RMS and Fixed Priority scheduling algorithms are static priority scheduling algorithms. EDF on the other hand is dynamic priority scheduling algorithm.
